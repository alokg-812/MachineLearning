## Welcome
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction to Generative Artificial Intelligence</p>

## Machine learning's new path
Over the last several years, machine learning (ML) has rapidly expanded the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in the world of IT. Today, that expansion has entered the domain of generative AI. Generative AI is making it easier to innovate faster and reduce the number of hours needed for development. This provides you with more time to grow your business.
<br>
In this course, you are introduced to `generative AI`. You learn what generative AI is. You also learn about the benefits of generative AI, foundation models, and the services that AWS offers that you can use to build your generative AI solutions. 


## Course objectives
By the end of this course you will be able to do the following:
- Define generative artificial intelligence (AI).
- Describe foundation models.
- Discuss use cases for generative AI.
- Identify the features and benefits of AWS generative AI services.


## What is generative Al?
*Generative AI* is type of AI that can create new content and ideas including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. <br>

- AI generators are powered by `machine learning models`.
- These ML models are capable of producing content.
- These contents are editable so that we can modify them as per our needs.

* Generative AI is a `subset` of machine learning.
  
### Traditional ML vs Generative AI

| Feature                            | Traditional ML                                               | Generative AI                                                     |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Training Data`                    | Models perform tasks based on data that you provide.         | Models are pre-trained on massive amounts of general domain data. |
| `Task Scope`                       | Each model can perform only one task.                        | Models can perform multiple tasks.                                |
| `Content Creation`                 | Models need to be carefully trained on the data you provide. | Models can actually generate content.                             |



## Foundation models
- At the core of every AI model, there is a foundation model or a classic model that are powerful machine learning model differentiated on their ability to be pre-trained on some predefined on vast amount of data in order to perform a wide amount of downstream tasks.
- These tasks include text generation, data summarization, information extraction, question and answer responses and chatbot interactions.

## Foundation model types
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1d2d6bd-8691-4703-8616-d6936bda9036)

### Text-to-text
Text-to-text foundation models (FMs) are built for natural language processing tasks that are developed by the ML research community, startups, and established companies. Many organizations have had a chance to experiment with generative large language models (LLMs) that can do things like summarize text, extract information, respond to questions, and create content. These models take a user's input text and extend it with new, generated text (for example, sentence auto-completion).

### Text-to-embeddings 
Text-to-embeddings FMs are another type of LLM that can compare pieces of text (inputs), like what a user types into a search bar with indexed data, and makes a connection between the two. Amazon's product search uses this type of LLM to compare a user's ask with catalog data and present the user with more accurate and relevant results.

### Multimodal 
Multimodel FMs can understand and generate different formats, such as text and images. These types of FMs can generate images based on natural language prompts. An example of this is Stable Diffusion.

## Benefits of using AWS for your generative Al solutions

- Flexibility
- Secure customization
- Cost-effective infrastructure
- Builder friendly
- AWS services

### Flexibility
- **Challenge:** Customers need a straightforward way to find and access high-performing FMs that are best suited for their business.
- **AWS solution:** AWS offers a wide selection of FMs built by Amazon and top Al startups, including Al21 Labs, Anthropic, and Stability Al.

### Secure customization
- **Challenge:** Customers want to easily take the base FM and build differentiated applications using their own data. They need their data to stay completely protected, secure, and private.
- **AWS solution:** Using Amazon Bedrock, customers can fine tune models for a particular task without having to annotate large volumes of data (as few as 20 examples is enough). No customer data is used to train the underlying models. All data is encrypted and stays within the customerâ€™s virtual private cloud (VPC).

### Cost-effective infrastructure
- **Challenge:** To fully use FMs, customers need the high-performing, cost-effective infrastructure purpose-built for ML.
- **AWS solution:** AWS offers the best price performance for generative AI with infrastructure powered by AWS-designed ML chips and NVIDIA GPUs. With AWS, customers can cost-effectively scale infrastructure to train and run FMs containing hundreds of billions of parameters.

## AWS generative Al services

### Amazon Bedrock
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes FMs from Amazon and leading Al startups available through an API. This means you can choose from various FMs to find the model that's best suited for your use case. Amazon Bedrock makes it easier for developers to create generative Al applications that can deliver up-to-date answers based on proprietary knowledge sources. They can also complete tasks for a wide range of use cases.

### Amazon Q Developer
Amazon Q Developer is an Al coding companion that generates real-time, single-line or full-function code suggestions in your IDE to help you quickly build software. With Amazon Q Developer, you can write a comment in natural language that outlines a specific task in English, such as "Upload a file with server-side encryption." Based on this information, Amazon Q Developer recommends one or more code snippets directly in the IDE that can accomplish the task. You can quickly and easily accept the top suggestion (Tab key), view more suggestions (arrow keys), or continue writing your own code. You should always review a code suggestion before accepting them, and you might need to edit it to ensure it does exactly what you intended.
