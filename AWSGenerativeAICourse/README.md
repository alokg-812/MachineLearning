## Welcome
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction to Generative Artificial Intelligence</p>

## Machine learning's new path
Over the last several years, machine learning (ML) has rapidly expanded the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in the world of IT. Today, that expansion has entered the domain of generative AI. Generative AI is making it easier to innovate faster and reduce the number of hours needed for development. This provides you with more time to grow your business.
<br>
In this course, you are introduced to `generative AI`. You learn what generative AI is. You also learn about the benefits of generative AI, foundation models, and the services that AWS offers that you can use to build your generative AI solutions. 


## Course objectives
By the end of this course you will be able to do the following:
- Define generative artificial intelligence (AI).
- Describe foundation models.
- Discuss use cases for generative AI.
- Identify the features and benefits of AWS generative AI services.


## What is generative Al?
*Generative AI* is type of AI that can create new content and ideas including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. <br>

- AI generators are powered by `machine learning models`.
- These ML models are capable of producing content.
- These contents are editable so that we can modify them as per our needs.

### Traditional ML vs Generative AI

| Feature                            | Traditional ML                                               | Generative AI                                                     |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Training Data`                    | Models perform tasks based on data that you provide.         | Models are pre-trained on massive amounts of general domain data. |
| `Task Scope`                       | Each model can perform only one task.                        | Models can perform multiple tasks.                                |
| `Content Creation`                 | Models need to be carefully trained on the data you provide. | Models can actually generate content.                             |
